# [Frontend Mentor - Landing Page](https://bryanaguilar-easybank.netlify.app/)

This is a solution to the [Easybank landing page challenge on Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/easybank-landing-page-WaUhkoDN).

## Description

This project presents the construction of a landing page built from scratch using HTML SCSS and JS, the site is fully responsive and contains animations that improve the user experience. Your users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page

## Installation

The project has been created using two extensions of visual studio code: [Live Sass Compiler](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ritwickdey.live-sass "Live Sass Compiler") to compile the SCSS code to CSS and [Live Server](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ritwickdey.LiveServer "Live Server") to visualize the changes made in the browser (hot reload).

To properly configure [Live Sass Compiler](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ritwickdey.live-sass "Live Sass Compiler"), I recommend you watch [this video tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1tyKkkziTc&t=10s&ab_channel=FalconMasters "this video tutorial") from the [Falcon Masters channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCJl1YajcPWTeJNsQhGyMIMg "Falcon Masters channel").

In my case I have set the build directory as `dist/`. In case you configure this directory with another name, you must change it in the following line of the `index.html` file

```html
<link rel="stylesheet" href="/dist/style.css">
```
